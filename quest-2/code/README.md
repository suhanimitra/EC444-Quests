# Code Readme

We took code from numerous files. For one, we used the cluster-02/15 as the basis of our main file. This contained accelerometer code. We added in temperature sensing from our past quest-01. We added in alphanumeric display code from cluster-02/13 as well button interrupt from cluster-02/14.

For node/canvas processing, we took the node folders from cluster-02/16 and cluster-02/17 such that we could integrate a node app to read the data and serve it to a client.
