# Code Readme

Team: Leyandra Burke, Suhani Mitra, Margherita Piana, Kyla Wilson

This code was drawn from our previous GPIO skill (cluster-0/06). It assists in processing GPIO input. We used this as the foundation of our code and built off this along with the provided ADC example code from Espressif from our previous skills in this cluster (cluster-1, skills 07-12). Please see comments for sources for supplemental code snippets.
